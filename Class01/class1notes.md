This morning we made a Github Pages site! These are the beginner how to's!

## HEADINGS

To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three (<h3>), use three number signs (e.g., ### My Header)! Or alternatively, you could use.

Try to put a space between the number signs (#) and the heading name! Also put a blank space between each line before and after a heading!
To make a second smaller header underneath the first heading, on the line below the text, add any number of == characters for heading level 1 or -- characters for heading level 2.

### PARAGRAPHS

To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text!
Unless the paragraph is in a list, don’t indent paragraphs with spaces or tabs.

#### LINE BREAKS

You can use two or more spaces (commonly referred to as “trailing whitespace”) for line breaks in nearly every Markdown application, but it’s controversial. It’s hard to see trailing whitespace in an editor, and many people accidentally or intentionally put two spaces after every sentence. For this reason, you may want to use something other than trailing whitespace for line breaks. If your Markdown application supports HTML, you can use the <br> HTML tag.
